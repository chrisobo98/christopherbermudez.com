### **It‚Äôs Groundhog Day, but your alarm clock is a new client request.**

:br

A restaurant needs a website. They need a menu page. They need an "About Us". They need a contact form. And you, the developer, are staring at your terminal, about to type `npx nuxi init` for what feels like the thousandth time.

:br

You know the drill. You've built this site a dozen times. But you're faced with two bad choices:

:br

**1. Start from scratch... again.** You get total control, but you're spending 20 hours setting up the same boilerplate, wrestling with state management for a simple pickup cart, and configuring the same SEO meta tags. It's safe, but it's slow. Your hourly rate weeps.

:br

**2. Buy a "Premium" Theme.** You save time upfront, but then you spend the next 40 hours trying to untangle a jungle of spaghetti props, mystery components, and 20 pages of documentation just to change the damn button color. The code is bloated, the performance is a joke, and it wasn't built for a real developer to actually *use*.

:br

I was tired of it. I knew there had to be a better way.

:br

## **Introducing: The Templates Page**

:br

I‚Äôm thrilled to announce a new section of my site: **[Templates](/templates)**.

:br

These aren't your typical, over-engineered theme-forest nightmares. These are developer-first, white-label templates built for the real world. They‚Äôre built the way you or I would actually build a project for a client.

:br

No fluff. No vendor lock-in. Just a rock-solid, high-performance foundation to cut your production time in half (or more).

:br

And the first one is ready to go.

:br

## **üçó Meet QuickBite: Your Next Restaurant Project, Done.**

:br

**QuickBite** is a white-label restaurant menu website built with Nuxt 3, TypeScript, and a fully modular, performance-obsessed ecosystem.

:br

It‚Äôs made for freelancers and agencies building for restaurants, caf√©s, or takeout businesses. It integrates a full menu system, a pickup email form, and a blog ‚Äì all set up for real-world speed, SEO, and scale.

:br

### **So, What Does "Developer-First" Actually Mean?**

:br

It means the template respects your time and your craft.

:br

- **It‚Äôs DRY and readable.** You can open any file and understand what‚Äôs happening without a map.
- **It‚Äôs built for customization.** Want to change the branding? It's a few lines in the Tailwind config. Need to add a new menu item? The content structure is dead simple.
- **It‚Äôs not bloated.** It has exactly what a restaurant site needs and nothing it doesn‚Äôt. You're not loading 50 unused JavaScript libraries.

:br

## **‚öôÔ∏è What's Under the Hood?**

:br

This isn't just a pretty face. QuickBite is powered by a hand-picked stack of Nuxt modules that I use in my own client projects to guarantee performance and maintainability.

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">All the meta, schema, and OG tags are ready to go.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
    <p class="font-bold text-white">@nuxt/image & Fonts</p>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">Optimized images and fonts out of the box for top-tier speed.</p>
  </div>
</div>

Plus a whole suite of other tools for i18n, device detection, and analytics. It's the full package.

:br

## **Stop Reinventing the Wheel. Start Building Faster.**

:br

This is just the beginning. A template for **Realtors and Real Estate** is already in the works.

:br

My goal is to give you the ultimate head start. Take these templates, brand them as your own, and deliver high-quality, high-performance websites to your clients in record time.
